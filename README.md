This repository contains code for classifying estrous cycle phases in cells. We use various machine learning algorithms for this task.

## Work In Progress. More information to come.

# Install Dependencies (Anaconda)
We use Anaconda to manage our Python environment. Download Anaconda here: https://www.anaconda.com/download/

Once Anaconda is installed, create the envrionment from the dependencies file. The Python dependencies are listed   in `environment.yml`. 

From the project root, run: 
``` conda env create -f environment.yml```.
