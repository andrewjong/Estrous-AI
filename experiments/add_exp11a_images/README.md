Received ~300 more scored image samples from Experiment 11a. Trained on top of `random_affine_crop` augmentation.

Experiment 11a had both 10x and 20x images. The `_filtered` experiments means
20x was filtered out. The filtered version performs better by 2 points.
Hypothesize this is because not enough 20x images

Results: performed slightly worse. Perhaps because the newly collected images look different from the original?
